# Dropdown-selected-graphs-with-Dash-by-Plotly

This repo contains a Dash example which I created by exploiting the Dropdown, html, and io dependencies of Plotly.

The code is simple to execute. The graph has a dropdown with graph names, when selected show the respective graph.

I also used several datasets to display the graphs to make it easier for them to be displayed using the specific graph.

Datasets exploited:
1. Tips
2. local college dataset by Guvi
3. Medals
4. Pima Indian Diabetes
5. IRIS
6. Gapminder World

Dash running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
